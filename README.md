# Time-domain multi-scale Full waveform inversion
This is an FWI package I developed during my master's thesis.
I developed all of the scripts except drivop.m, developed by Dr. Ali Gholami, University of Tehran.
Open CG_MFWI_Parallel.m to use the package.
A simple reverse-time migration code is also provided (RTM.m).
