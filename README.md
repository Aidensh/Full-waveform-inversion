# Time-domain multi-scale Full waveform inversion
This a FWI pakage I developed during my masters thesis.
All of the scripts are developed by me except drivop.m which is developed by Dr. Ali Gholami, University of Tehran.
Open CG_MFWI_Parallel.m to use the package.
A simple reverse-time migration code is also provided (RTM.m).
